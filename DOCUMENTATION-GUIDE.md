### For Specific Tasks

#### "I want to understand what this system does"
→ Start with [README.md](README.md) - Overview section

#### "I need to compare this with another registry system"
→ Read [ApplicationRegistry-README.md](ApplicationRegistry-README.md) - Comparison Guide section

#### "I want to integrate my microservice with this framework"
→ Follow [ApplicationRegistry-README.md](ApplicationRegistry-README.md) - Usage Patterns section

#### "I need to deploy this in production"
→ Check [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) - Deployment Architecture section

#### "I want to improve the codebase"
→ Review [CODE_REVIEW.md](CODE_REVIEW.md) - Recommendations sections

#### "I'm looking for API endpoints"
→ See [ApplicationRegistry-README.md](ApplicationRegistry-README.md) - API Reference section

#### "I need to understand the database schema"
→ View [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) - Database Architecture section or [ApplicationRegistry-README.md](ApplicationRegistry-README.md) - Data Model section

### For Copilot Integration

This documentation is structured to be **copilot-friendly** for comparing with other codebases:

1. **Clear hierarchical structure** - Easy to navigate and reference
2. **Detailed component descriptions** - Understand what each piece does
3. **Comparison guide included** - Direct mapping to other systems (Consul, Eureka, Service Fabric)
4. **Missing pieces checklist** - Identify gaps when comparing
5. **Code examples** - See how things work in practice
6. **Architectural diagrams (ASCII)** - Visual understanding without external files

### Key Concepts to Understand

Before diving deep, understand these core concepts:

1. **Three-Level Hierarchy** - Application → Version → Instance
2. **Hash-Based Verification** - Applications verified by assembly hash
3. **Automatic Discovery** - Controllers discovered via reflection
4. **Health Monitoring** - Background services continuously check health
5. **Friendly Names** - Services discovered by friendly name, not URL

### Comparing with Another System

Follow these steps to compare this system with another:

1. **Read the Comparison Guide** in [ApplicationRegistry-README.md](ApplicationRegistry-README.md)
2. **Check the Missing Pieces Checklist** - What features are unique?
3. **Review the Data Model** - How is data organized differently?
4. **Examine the API Reference** - What endpoints are available?
5. **Understand the Registration Flow** - How do services register?
6. **Study the Discovery Flow** - How are services found?
7. **Review Health Monitoring** - How is health tracked?

### Using This Documentation for Integration

If you're building a bridge between this system and another:

1. **Start with API Reference** - Understand available endpoints
2. **Review Data Model** - Map entities to your system
3. **Study Registration Process** - Replicate or integrate
4. **Check Discovery Process** - Understand lookup mechanism
5. **Review Code Examples** - See patterns in action
6. **Consider Integration Points** - Identified in Comparison Guide
